The household's problem is:
$$
v(k,l,z,K) = \max_{k'} u(lw(z,K)+(1+r(z,K)-\delta)k-k')+\beta E[v(k',l',z',K')|l,z]
$$
subject to $k'\geq 0$ and $\log K'=\alpha_1(z)+\alpha_2(z) \log K$, where we substituted in the budget constraint $c+k'=lw(z,K)+(1+r(z,K)-\delta)k$.
The first order condition with respect to $k'$ and the envelope condition jointly imply the following Euler equation:
$$
u'(c) \geq \beta E[(1+r(z',K')-\delta)u'(c')|l,z]
$$

The rental rate of capital and the wage can be computed from the first order conditions of the firm's problem. These are:
$$
r(z,K) = \alpha z\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)^{\alpha-1}
$$
$$
w(z,K) = (1-\alpha)z\left(\frac{K}{L}\right)^{\alpha}
$$

Figure \ref{capstock} shows the evolution of the capital stock over 1000 periods. Our estimated law of motion was:
$$
\log K_{t+1} = \begin{cases}
0.1278 + 0.9635 \log K_t & \text{if } z_t = 0.99 \\
0.1402 + 0.9616 \log K_t & \text{if } z_t = 1.01
\end{cases}
$$
where the bad-state regression had an $R^2$ of 0.99992 and the good-state regression had an $R^2$ of 0.99996.

As a robustness check, we repeated the exercise with different draws for the aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks and we initialized the conjecture for the law of motion of capital to the law of motion shown above.
Our new law of motion was very similar to the previous one:
$$
\log K_{t+1} = \begin{cases}
0.1214 + 0.9653 \log K_t & \text{if } z_t = 0.99 \\
0.1380 + 0.9622 \log K_t & \text{if } z_t = 1.01
\end{cases}
$$
This is suggestive that our original estimated law of motion was accurate since it essentially holds up even under a completely different series of shock realizations.
In both cases, the intercept is higher in the good state, consistent with the intuition that higher productivity today should imply more capital accumulation for a given level of today's capital, since productivity is highly persistent.
